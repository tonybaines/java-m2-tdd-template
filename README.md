Download the zip as a quick-start Maven 2 project

        https://github.com/tonybaines/java-m2-tdd-template/archive/master.zip

To prepare a ready-to-go project e.g. for tutorials run the packaging script

        $ ./package

Which will (re)create a zip file with the source, pom.xml and libraries for emergency offline use in 'libs',
along with project files for IDEA and Eclipse. 

N.B. If working offline, the libraries will need to be manually switched to use the ones in 'libs'
